# Hello!
I'm Ivan. I'm a modern telegram bot for downloading music from youtube.

To start me you need to do the following steps:

1) Download this repositiry;
2) Get bot's token from @BotFather;
3) Set TOKEN value in config.py;
4) Enjoy it!

Technical requirements:

1) Windows 7, 8.1 or 10;
2) Python 3.7+.

I were seperated on different components and commented all the code as maximum extent possible. So you won't get any trouble adding new features.

If you want to contribute your ideas to this project, please contact my developer.

Have a nice day :)
